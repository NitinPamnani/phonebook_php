# phonebook_php
Out of sheer joblessness and just as to begin with learning PHP, I have made this very simple project called phonebook in PHP.
#Steps to setup the phonebook
 1. Create a table name list under the MySQL database phonebook. (If you desire to use a different table name, you can make the changes in DBWork.php file)
 2. Start your local server and run the index.php file and the rest is self-explanatory.
